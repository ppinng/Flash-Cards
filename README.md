# 🈶 For Chinese

> _A sarcastic love poem to the language that broke my brain._

**Oh Chinese, my love, so graceful, so kind,**  
You twist up my tongue and torment my mind.  
Your tones are a joy — just four ways to cry,  
Say “ma” the wrong way, and someone might die.

💔 _Dedicated to every student who thought this would be easy subject._
